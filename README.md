# <h1> **Program summary:** <h1>
	
	This project is the creation of a command shell program called rshell. 
	Main functions of the shell are to print a command prompt (e.g. $), 
	read in a command and any available connectors (|| or && or ;), and 
	execute the command(s). The design consists of five main classes, two 
	of which can be considered as the core of the program. This is to enhance 
	the programâ€™s efficiency during execution and to maintain a simplistic 
	design that allows for easy alterations for future developments.

# <h1> **Known bugs:** <h1>

	Below is a table of known bugs that we have recorded during our testings. 
	Note that this table does not reflect all possible errors available in the 
	code. These bugs are based on test cases we have thought of at the moment. 
	The current amount of bugs may or may not be the complete amount. However, 
	that does not mean that the code will function any less than the quality 
	desired.
